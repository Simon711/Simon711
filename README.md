I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at a local university. This profile is for me to back-up my assignments or projects that have been done in class, my exploration, self-learning, online courses, and also as my portfolio.

In case you have any doubts/inquiries, drop your message by pressing the `New discussion` green button on this page ‚Üí *[Simon's Discussion Page](https://github.com/simonnchong/simonnchong/discussions)*. And last, feel free to explore my repositories, have fun! And see you there!
