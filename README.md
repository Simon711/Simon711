# Hi there, it's SimonðŸ‘‹

## I am currently a student studying Bachelor of Computer Science in Graphic and Multimedia Software at a local university. This profile is for me to backup my assignments or projects that have been done in class, my own exploration, self learning, online courses, also as my portfolio.

## Feel free to explore it! My own website will be launched soon, stay tuned!
